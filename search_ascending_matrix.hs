Given an m by n matrix of integers with each row and column in ascending order, search the matrix and find the row and column where a key k appears, or report that k is not in the matrix. For instance, in the matrix

 1  5  7  9
 4  6 10 15
 8 11 12 19
14 16 18 21

the key 11 appears in row 2, column 1 (indexing from 0) and the key 13 is not present in the matrix. The obvious algorithm takes time O(m Ã— n) to search the matrix row-by-row, but you must exploit the order in the matrix to find an algorithm that takes time O(m + n).

Your task is to write the requested search function.
