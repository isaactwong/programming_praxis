-- The population count of a bitstring is the number of set bits (1-bits) in the string. For instance, the population count of the number 23, which is represented in binary as 10111, is 4. The population count is used in cryptography and error-correcting codes, among other topics in computer science; some people use it as an interview question. The population count is also known as Hamming weight.

-- Your task is to write a function that determines the population count of a number representing a bitstring
