Todayâ€™s exercise comes from our unending list of interview questions:

Find the longest run of consecutive characters in a string that contains only two unique characters; if there is a tie, return the rightmost. For instance, given input string abcabcabcbcbc, the longest run of two characters is the 6-character run of bcbcbc that ends the string.

Your task is to write the requested program.
